## Introduction
This project is a step toward mastering cloud technologies and DevOps practices, aligning with my goal of becoming a Cloud Engineer within the next year.

It helps me gain hands-on experience with Git, version control, and collaborative development, which are essential skills in cloud operations.

## Technologies
Here’s what I’m using for this project:

- **Amazon EC2**: I'm developing my web app on Amazon EC2 virtual servers, so that software development and deployment happens entirely on the cloud.
- **VSCode**: For my IDE, I chose Visual Studio Code. It connects directly to my development EC2 instance, making it easy to edit code and manage files in the cloud.
- **GitHub**: All my web app code is stored and versioned in this GitHub repository.
- **[COMING SOON] AWS CodeArtifact**: Once it's rolled out, CodeArtifact will store my artifacts and dependencies, which is great for high availability and speeding up my project's build process.
- **[COMING SOON] AWS CodeBuild**: Once it's rolled out, CodeBuild will take over my build process. It'll compile the source code, run tests, and produce ready-to-deploy software packages automatically.
- **[COMING SOON] AWS CodeDeploy**: Once it's rolled out, CodeDeploy will automate my deployment process across EC2 instances.
- **[COMING SOON] AWS CodePipeline**: Once it's rolled out, CodePipeline will automate the entire process from GitHub to CodeDeploy, integrating build, test, and deployment steps into one efficient workflow.

**Git & GitHub:** Initially faced issues with authentication due to GitHub's switch from password authentication to Personal Access Tokens (PATs). Solved it by generating a PAT with the correct scope.
**Markdown:** Learning Markdown formatting was a challenge, but using a cheat sheet helped streamline the process.
